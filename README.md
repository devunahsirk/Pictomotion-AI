# PictoMotion AI: Image to Storyboard with Voice and Video


## Introduction

PictoMotion AI is an innovative platform that utilizes the power of artificial intelligence to convert static images into dynamic storyboards with voice-over narration and video animation. This repository contains the source code and documentation for PictoMotion AI, enabling developers and enthusiasts to explore, contribute, and utilize this cutting-edge technology.

## Key Features

- **Image to Storyboard Conversion:** PictoMotion AI can analyze an input image and automatically generate a dynamic storyboard based on its content.

- **Voice-over Narration:** The platform integrates text-to-speech technology to add professional voice narration to the storyboard.

- **Video Animation:** PictoMotion AI can transform the storyboard into an animated video, bringing life to the static images.

- **Customization Options:** Users can customize the storyboard layout, animation styles, and choose from multiple voice options.

## How PictoMotion AI Works

1. **Image Analysis:** The AI model processes the input image, recognizing objects, scenes, and emotions.

2. **Storyboard Generation:** Based on the image analysis, the platform creates a storyboard, dividing the image into frames, and arranging them to form a coherent sequence.

3. **Voice-over Narration:** The platform converts the storyboard's text content into voice narration using text-to-speech technology.

4. **Video Animation:** The storyboard frames and voice narration are combined to create an animated video.
